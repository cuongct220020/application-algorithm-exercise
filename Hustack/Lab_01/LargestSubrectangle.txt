Algorithm: 
    1. Run a loop to traverse through the rows
    
    2. Now if the current row is not the first row then update the row as follows. if matrix[i][j] is not zero then 
            matrix[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j] + maxtrix[i][j];

    3. Find the maximum rectangular area under the histogram, consider ith row as heights of bars of a histogram.
    
    4. Do the previous two step for all rows print the maximum area of all the rows.
